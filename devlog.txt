Regarding the preview loading time - I agreee that it is slow, however not much can be done from the web side. Perhaps the image generation can be sped up from backend, discuss with Sunjay.

Regarding the child being too big, this could be changed with Art assets, or simply by scaling in CSS (art assets preferred)
